Light is energy. Living cells thrive in light and your hair is no different. The end result is that the appearance of your hair will improve and you will feel good about your hair again. With two decades of clinical experience, the results seen with the laser used in the LaserComb are both encouraging and impressive. Direct experience shows that, unlike other treatments, men and women of all ages respond to the positive benefits of Laser PhotoTherapy. It is no surprise that satisfied users range in age from 18 to their late 80s. If you are concerned about your hair, the earlier you start using the HairMax LaserComb, the better. There's nothing more detrimental to a person's appearance than thin, lifeless hair. And the longer you wait to do something about it, the less chance there is of reversing the problem. That's where HairMax steps in to help. <table align=left width=250 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/hpc\/detail-page\/lcomb-1-lg.jpg\" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>The HairMax LaserComb is a safe, simple way to a fuller head of thick, luxurious-looking hair. <\/b><\/i> <small><\/td><\/tr><\/table> With more than 90% of all LaserComb users achieving satisfaction with their results, this device is a safe, simple way to a fuller head of thick, luxurious-looking hair. It is a proven fact that skin cells \"like\" light. Your hair is no different. Both men and women of all ages can benefit from laser light therapy provided by the LaserComb. Although individual results may vary, you should notice early improvements to the general appearance of your hair within the first eight to 16 weeks. These improvements should include shinier and thicker looking hair. In general, studies have shown that about 45% of LaserComb users see these results in as little as eight weeks of treatment. Another 45% realize benefits from use within eight to 16 weeks. A small group of users take longer and may not experience noticeable results before 16 weeks of use. Even <i>Time Magazine<\/i> spotted the benefits of LaserComb, featuring the invention in the December 4, 2000, \"Inventions of the Year\" issue. Over the course of several more months, you may notice your hair gradually become fuller, stronger, and denser looking. Over time, all users -- both men and women -- usually notice progressively increasing benefits as they continue to use the LaserComb. Conversely, once the usage stops, the appearance of the hair does gradually regress back to its original state. Like brushing your teeth to maintain healthy teeth and gums, regular LaserComb usage is recommend to keep your hair looking its best. As few as three times a week for 10 to 15 minutes a session is sufficient to see results. <table align=right width=175 cellpadding=10> <tr> <td> <img src=\"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/G\/01\/hpc\/detail-page\/lcomb-2-lg.jpg\" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>HairMax encourages the glide method for the best results. <\/b><\/i><\/small><\/td><\/tr> <\/table> <b>How to use the LaserComb<\/b><br> The LaserComb has been designed with both comfort and convenience in mind. To turn on the LaserComb, press the power button and then the laser button on the front of the unit. Next, place the LaserComb flat on your head using the two rows of teeth. Rather than constantly moving the device through your hair (as you would with a regular brush or comb), you should use a glide method by placing the LaserComb on a specific spot on your head and gently gliding it back about 0.5-inches each time the audible four-second beep occurs. Move from the front of your hairline to the back of your head, then repeat the process moving in the opposite direction. The glide method is the best way to ensure that the LaserComb will be as effective as possible. In addition to being very easy to operate, this device is also a relaxing and enjoyable product to use. There are no sprays, topical ointments, or powders to worry about, and it can be used in the comfort of your own home at your own convenience. <b>Proven Technology: Laser PhotoTherapy<\/b><br> For many years leading hair clinics and salons in Europe, Asia and around the world have been using Laser PhotoTherapy -- a form of laser technology also referred to as Low Level Laser Therapy -- to improve the appearance of thinning hair. Over and over individuals suffering from thin, lifeless hair have achieved great results with this form of therapy, but until just recently Laser PhotoTherapy was only available through exclusive hair clinics. These clinics rely on large, fixed laser devices, and, to be effective, a patient must attend many regularly scheduled, expensive in-office therapy sessions. With the HairMax LaserComb, Lexington International has miniaturized the internationally-acclaimed Laser PhotoTherapy technology. Now, with the LaserComb, it is possible to receive this effective hair care treatment in the comfort and privacy of your home, office, or hotel, and at a fraction of the cost charged by hair clinics. The LaserComb utilizes the scientific principle of Photo-Biostimulation that progressively improves the appearance of your hair over time. By harnessing the energizing and nourishing effects of Laser PhotoTherapy, HairMax makes your hair look healthy and vibrant. Remember, living cells thrive in light and your hair is no different. The Laser PhotoTherapy used in the LaserComb complies with USA laser product safety standards. The laser affects only your hair and you achieve benefits without any worrying side effects. Laser PhotoTherapy gives off no heat and is safe for consumers to use at home. Unlike the high powered lasers used in manufacturing, medical surgeries and science, Laser PhotoTherapy is a gentle, nourishing light therapy that has positive effects on hair. The HairMax LaserComb is safe to be used by itself or in conjunction with other treatments. <table align=center width=426 cellpadding=10> <td> <img

Ferula assa foetida root extract LEONOR GREYL is the brand specialist in hair treatments using only high grade natural ingredients  all environmentally safe. Sitting in his Parisian garden in 1997, Jean-Marie Greyl noticed that the roots of one of his bamboo plants were growing horizontally, sprawling across the neighboring plants. Taking a closer look, he realized just how hardy and fast-growing this plant is. He decided to extract its sap to add to a nourishing shampoo for repairing damaged lengths and ends. It became a must-have product for dry hair and it was the first shampoo to be created specifically for managing long hair. More than a mission statement, it is a guiding principle, initially chosen by Leonor and Jean-Marie Greyl and subsequently pursued with passion by their daughter Caroline. The brand came to be seen as a visionary pioneer in the field. Thanks to the powers of nature, Leonor Greyl emerged as a leading, exclusive haircare brand, a status it enjoys to this day. The family-run company&#039;s philosophy is based on meticulous and selective management of its sources of supply to treat clients around the world to premium, effective, innovative and natural ingredients that deliver exceptional results.

Powered by the Pro-12 Youth Optimizing Complex, Restorative Cream contains a tri-peptide amino acid protein that visibly tones skin and promotes fitness health, shea butter to support elasticity and moisture and NIA-114, to strengthen the skin barrier and supercharge the performance of other ingredients.

This ground-breaking technology helps to induce DNA repair genes and stimulate cell energy to revitalize skin. Truly transformative, it has also been shown to diminish wrinkles and improve elasticity while helping to boost the synthesis of new collagen and reduce free radicals. Raspberry plant stem cells deliver powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits that help reign in damage caused by stress. Stress has a special way of leaving its mark on even the most glowing complexions. Whether it's a life that's just too busy or environmental aggressors that just won't quit, skin reacts badly and begins to look irritated and exhausted, diminished and aged. Sodium Hyaluronate, derived from a natural barley extract, is a wrinkle filler that is deeply moisturizing and helps to restore skin's lipid barrier. It has been shown to significantly reduce wrinkle depth in 30 minutes and helps to restore skin's suppleness, elasticity and tone. Raspberry stem cells are a patented active derived from cultured raspberry cells with powerful antioxidant and DNA protection benefits. Offers immediate soothing and long-term protection for the skin. Specifically targets stress-induced inflammation and aging by reducing nitric oxide levels. Plant Peptide, also known as plant collagen, is derived from cultured plant stem cells and used to diminish wrinkles, improve elasticity, boost collagen production while helping protect and repair cell DNA. It has also been shown to reduce fine lines and wrinkles up to 25% in just three weeks. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/bb2c8496-c7e4-45cf-bb58-bb3169dc2725._SL220__.jpg\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/4427c652-e0d7-4fec-81a1-ac197de4b0cc._SL220__.jpg\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/12ac011b-82be-44d8-8e86-fbf07bc4745f._SL220__.jpg\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/ecf620de-4fb0-477d-9da9-8f33363e5988._SL220__.jpg\"> <img alt=\"Arctic Hydration Rubberizing Mask\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/991d11bc-efd9-4bd0-b6c4-30922eb97b54._CR0,0,300,300_PT0_SX300__.jpg\" class=\"a-spacing-mini\">\n    \n\n\n                            <br\/> <img alt=\"Face Lift In A Bag\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/94ca3182-6954-4485-befe-0d9118b0ae69._CR0,0,300,300_PT0_SX300__.jpg\" class=\"a-spacing-mini\">\n    \n\n\n                            <br\/> <img alt=\"Nordic Skin Peel\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/c7ffa90d-f28a-46b0-b0a9-940a95ae4b7f._CR0,0,300,300_PT0_SX300__.jpg\" class=\"a-spacing-mini\">\n    \n\n\n                            <br\/> <span class=\"a-text-bold\">What it is:  <\/span>A transformative vitamin C rich peel-off mask that supercharges stressed and depleted skin with an instant dose of deep hydration while locking in potent natural actives plus vital nutrients to replenish and reenergize in minutes. <span class=\"a-text-bold\">How to use: <\/span>  Squeeze the gel base (pouch 1) and treatment powder  (pouch 2) into tray and mix with the spatula until combined to a paste.

Second to the razor blade, the badger hair shave brush is the essential tool used to achieve the best shave possible. Badger hair has a great ability to retain water (which helps create a lather when mixed with a shave cream), improving the barrier between the razor and skin, and lifting facial hair to ensure a smoother shave with less irritation. <em>Welcome to cutting-edge skincare created by Baxter Finley in 1965.

Dead cells begin to accumulate on the surface of your skin, causing a rough, dull, and discolored appearance. But by exfoliating daily with a gentle glycolic exfoliant, you will actively remove and keep away the dulling dead cells, revealing the smoother, brighter, and younger-looking skin that you&#039;ve had all along. Daily exfoliation not only makes your skin look younger, but it also does so much more: - Increases firmness and brightness of skin. - Improves makeup application and efficacy of skincare products. - Helps prevent and control acne breakouts. - Decreases appearance of pore size. - Helps remove unwanted brown discoloration. <span class=\"a-size-small a-color-secondary\">\n        BeautyRx founder, Dr. Neal Schultz\n    <\/span>","keywords":"step beautyrx essential exfoliating serum advancedstrength glycolic exfoliating pads effectively remove dead skin cells reveal radiant younger looking skin combined chemical physical exfoliation work gently skin tone improve skin texture help reduce fine lines wrinkles starterstrength product beautyrx dr schultz evolved feedback patient visits dr schultzs dermatology practice beautyrx offers comprehensive skincare collection built industryleading glycolic exfoliants img alt srchttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesgaplusautomationvendorimagescdececfbeabfjpg_cb__sl__jpg img alt srchttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesgaplusautomationvendorimagesffdffcbbcafcpng_cb__sl__png img alt srchttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesgaplusautomationvendorimagescbaffaaefacdpng_cb__sl__png img alt srchttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesgaplusautomationvendorimagesbbefafcfbbeffcfcjpg_cb__sl__jpg skin cells supposed renew days age process slows dead cells begin accumulate surface skin causing rough dull discolored appearance exfoliating daily gentle glycolic exfoliant actively remove away dulling dead cells revealing smoother brighter youngerlooking skin youve daily exfoliation makes skin look younger increases firmness brightness skin improves makeup application efficacy skincare products helps prevent control acne breakouts decreases appearance pore size helps remove unwanted brown discoloration span classasizesmall acolorsecondary beautyrx founder dr neal schultz span","brand":"BeautyRx","price":"70.00","itemModelNumber":"208","imageURLHighRes":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41QHmjK9BEL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/514CSJVEwlL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51c7UO%2BAmLL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/31Yc41xHGjL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51-RIb5kpiL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51vPu36FudL.jpg"],"ranking":"109,494","productDimensions":"3 x 3 x 2.8 inches ; 5.6 ounces","shippingWeight":"5.6 ounces","domesticShipping":"Item can be shipped within U.S.","internationalShipping":"This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.","discontinuedByManufacturer":null,"batteries":null},{"index":534,"asin":"B00UGAQX8C","productTitle":"Therapeutics Corrective Soothing Serum, 1 Ounce","primaryCategory":"Beauty & Personal Care","secondaryCategory":"Luxury Beauty","description":"Revitalize skin with this elegant, nutrient rich formula designed to help restore the skin's natural barrier function to calm irritation, increase strength and enhance radiance.

Remove existing nail lacquer then trim and shape nails by filing in one direction only to prevent breakage! Apply cuticle oil, push back cuticles and remove hangnails. Finally, cleanse to remove oil. Step 2: Apply Infinite Shine ProStay Primer to anchor color and gloss. Step 3: Apply two coats of Infinite Shine color, using three strokes for each coat. Apply the first down the middle and then one on each side for complete coverage. Step 4: Apply Infinite Shine ProStay Gloss to activate the system, locking in shine. OPI Infinite Shine ProStay Primer and ProStay Gloss, when used with Infinite Shine color, offer real staying power with up to 11 days of wear. When applying all three steps, this state-of-the-art system yields glossier, shinier, longer-wearing results. The primer acts as an anchor to the nail for the rest of the system, while simultaneously preventing staining. The gloss contains initiators that activate the entire system when exposed to natural light, linking the color and gloss layers together and locking in shine. <a class=\"a-link-normal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/0aafd815-ff2f-4638-8fac-dedbe339686e.jpg\">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/0aafd815-ff2f-4638-8fac-dedbe339686e._SL300__.jpg\" class=\"a-spacing-mini\" \/>\n        <\/a>\n    \n    \n\n\n                            <br \/>  <a class=\"a-link-normal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/a4e0794a-a9f1-4cb8-b540-cb506d126de6.jpg\">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/a4e0794a-a9f1-4cb8-b540-cb506d126de6._SL300__.jpg\" class=\"a-spacing-mini\" \/>\n        <\/a>\n    \n    \n\n\n                            <br \/>  <a class=\"a-link-normal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/3ec79355-5483-416a-9857-1fe1b84e8b03.jpg\">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/S\/aplus-media\/vc\/3ec79355-5483-416a-9857-1fe1b84e8b03._SL300__.jpg\" class=\"a-spacing-mini\" \/>\n        <\/a>\n    \n    \n\n\n                            <br \/>  - Largest selection of nail polish colors. - Easiest removal. - Up to 7 days wear &amp; shine. - High-gloss shine. - Easy removal. - Up to 11 days wear &amp; shine.

It also acts as a superior astringent for oily and acne-prone skin. A powerful combination of lactic acid and 2% salicylic acid works to exfoliate the top layer of dead skin cells, unearthing the trapped facial hairs that can cause razor bumps. Our PureScience formula also helps dissolve the pore-clogging facial oils that cause acne and blackheads. Bump Fix contains hydrating and soothing ingredients to effectively counteract dryness and irritation. Jack Black uses the highest-quality natural ingredients in our PureScience formulas. The addition of a 2% blend of salicylic acid works to exfoliate the top layer of dead skin cells and dissolve pore-clogging oil and dirt. It also smooths rough skin surfaces and can significantly improve your skins appearance. Lactic acid is added to moisturize, exfoliate, soften, and smooth the skin. Hyaluronic acid is a lightweight moisturizer and has excellent water-binding capabilities. Weve added organic green tea extract to provide anti-inflammatory properties, while organic chamomile extract, willowherb extract, and allantoin work together to fight free radicals, reduce redness, and smooth and calm the skin. Our PureScience formulas are free of synthetic fragrance, colorants, and parabens. Every product features certified organic ingredients and is cruelty free and dermatologist tested. For optimal results, apply Bump Fix to clean skin. Moisten a cotton pad and cover the entire affected area (face, neck, back) with a thin layer, one to three times daily. Do not rinse. Until skin acclimates to the treatment, begin with one application daily, at night; gradually increase usage to two or three times daily. To minimize the chance of irritation or stinging, wait 30 minutes after shaving to use this product. Apply before your post-shave gel, moisturizer, or sun protection.

IMPERIAL BARBER PRODUCTS set out to evolve the craft of American mens grooming by bringing time-honored grooming traditions into the home via all-natural, utilitarian, premium products. Founded in 2009 by Master Barbers Scott Serrata and Pedro Zermeno, Imperial Barber Products set out to evolve the craft of American mens grooming by bringing time-honored grooming traditions into the home via all-natural, utilitarian, premium products. Today, Imperial Barber Products has become an authority in masculine mens grooming. The team behind Imperial Barber Products have spent a combined 30 years in the Los Angeles, London and New York City barber culture. During that time, they worked to perfect the craft of classic American mens styling. In all those years they never found a hair or grooming product that worked perfectly. Pomades, gels and waxes were too weak, too greasy and waxy, or too fragrant, while shaving products often fell victim to an onslaught of hype that never met expectations. The Imperial team decided to work together to build the perfect products themselves. Purveyors of timeless products rooted in traditional mens grooming, the Imperial team embraces and supports classic American styling. Each product is custom formulated and crafted with performance, utility and function in mind. All products adhere to the same guidelines: Made by barbers. Made to work. Made in the USA.","keywords":"waterbased hydrating vitamin b infused gel pomade combines best properties gels pomades create new hybrid styling medium hold strength gel pomade goes light smooth provides sculptable precision dry hair harden day stayinplace hold strength hold determined product water hair application gel pomade works base users mix cocktail product classic pomade blacktop pomade fiber pomade precise holds sides add volume light blow dry gel pomade especially good finer hair thicken enhance volume enhance curls crunched hair finishing products waterreactivatable conveniently rinses gel pomade available travelfriendly oz size imperial barber products set evolve craft american mens grooming bringing timehonored grooming traditions home allnatural utilitarian premium products founded master barbers scott serrata pedro zermeno imperial barber products set evolve craft american mens grooming bringing timehonored grooming traditions home allnatural utilitarian premium products today imperial barber products authority masculine mens grooming team imperial barber products spent combined years los angeles london new york city barber culture time worked perfect craft classic american mens styling years found hair grooming product worked perfectly pomades gels waxes weak greasy waxy fragrant shaving products fell victim onslaught hype met expectations imperial team decided work build perfect products purveyors timeless products rooted traditional mens grooming imperial team embraces supports classic american styling product custom formulated crafted performance utility function mind products adhere guidelines barbers work usa","brand":"Imperial","price":"","itemModelNumber":"5024","imageURLHighRes":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51id%2BS7vWdL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/31hBphqOu2L.jpg"],"ranking":"141,598","productDimensions":"3.7 x 3.7 x 3.2 inches","shippingWeight":"14.1 ounces","domesticShipping":"Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO\/FPO addresses.

Created to accompany the romantic Jean Patou Joy scent, the rich body cream will keep your skin intensely hydrated, whilst enwrapping it in the extraordinary floral aroma of Joy. First launched in 1930, leading couturier Jean Patou created Joy as a gift to American women who could no longer afford his clothes following the stock market crash of 1929.

This finding led scientists to harness the restorative properties of the snail secretion for anti-aging skincare benefits.

One of the most recognized and influential brands in the world, Calvin Klein is the pre-eminent authority among fashions modernist designers. His name is synonymous with purity, luxury and a refined design aesthetic. <span class=\"a-size-small a-color-secondary\">\n        Discover CK2\n    <\/span> The CK2advertising campaign was shot by acclaimed photographer Ryan McGinley, whose unapologetic, controversial and real vision perfectly complements the spontaneity and thrill of ck2. The advertising creative features four stories that fold into one another in unexpected ways, creating authentic echoes between glances and the kind of lust or attraction couples can provide. Against the backdrop of urban and natural settings, four couples play out the free spirited, raw and passionate narratives of todays youth. The meaningful connections emphasize the thrill of life shared by two people and magnify the uniqueness of each relationship in our lives shared through a tapestry of experiences and emotion that ultimately define who we are. CK2 reinterprets minimalism and art by inviting you to look through the clear container and experience the scent before applying. An expression of ck2s gender-free fragrance, the 2-part design unites male and female elements. A sleek rounded bulb of glass houses the juice and sits atop a solid square cap that also serves as a unit to maintain the bottle upside down. Both the bottle and cap go beyond the classic fragrance bottle to create two pieces perfectly in-sync and connected to each other, much like the connection of two people. The bottle is a pure, transparent and futuristic design that is cool and gender-free. CK2 is a dual-faceted scent that balances two opposing forces: the strike of spicy electric freshness and the warmth of magnetic woods. A signature fragrance for an urban, alternative, new freshness. Complex while cool and natural, two fragrance worlds merge together to create an exuberant, intimate and contrasted connection.","keywords":"ck dualfaceted scent balances opposing forces strike spicy electric freshness warmth magnetic woods recognized influential brands world calvin klein preeminent authority fashions modernist designers synonymous purity luxury refined design aesthetic span classasizesmall acolorsecondary discover ck span ckadvertising campaign shot acclaimed photographer ryan mcginley unapologetic controversial real vision perfectly complements spontaneity thrill ck advertising creative features stories fold unexpected ways creating authentic echoes glances kind lust attraction couples provide backdrop urban natural settings couples play free spirited raw passionate narratives todays youth meaningful connections emphasize thrill life shared people magnify uniqueness relationship lives shared tapestry experiences emotion ultimately define ck reinterprets minimalism art inviting look clear container experience scent applying expression cks genderfree fragrance design unites male female elements sleek rounded bulb glass houses juice sits atop solid square cap serves unit maintain bottle upside bottle cap classic fragrance bottle create pieces perfectly insync connected like connection people bottle pure transparent futuristic design cool genderfree ck dualfaceted scent balances opposing forces strike spicy electric freshness warmth magnetic woods signature fragrance urban alternative new freshness complex cool natural fragrance worlds merge create exuberant intimate contrasted connection","brand":"Calvin","price":"","itemModelNumber":null,"imageURLHighRes":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/21AIwDvGdWL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/21F8mDCFNLL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/31-uT8A5CBL.jpg"],"ranking":"426,737","productDimensions":"3 x 1 x 1 inches","shippingWeight":"1.6 ounces","domesticShipping":"Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO\/FPO addresses.

Calprox is the unprecedented science behind Supersmile; a proprietary technology of encapsulated calcium peroxide with other minerals. Calprox works by gently and effectively dissolving the sticky bio-film from your teeth to which plaque, bacteria and stains (such as coffee, tea, tobacco, red wine and anything that will stain a white shirt) adhere. By dissolving the bio-film, Calprox removes stains and remineralizes enamel without the risk of sensitivity. This proprietary formula leaves the teeth whiter, feeling cleaner and healthier. Q: Is Calprox safe on dental work? Studies have proven that Calprox is as safe as water on your dental work. Many toothpastes use silica (an abrasive sand-like material) to whiten teeth by scratching away surface stains. Because silica is highly abrasive, over time it can thin the enamel. Thin enamel causes sensitivity and may lead to more serious oral problems as well as causing the teeth to look yellow. Calprox allows for safe whitening with no risk of sensitivity. Calprox contains minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphates, and when combined with fluoride it remineralizes and restores enamel. Calprox is found in almost all supersmile products. We are proudly free of silica, parabens, sulfates, known allergens, animal by-products, triclosan, microbeads, polyethylene, and BPA. Q: Will Supersmile products work on all types of teeth? Supersmile will work on all types of teeth including natural teeth, veneers, crowns, bonding and even dentures. Supersmile is also great to use with orthodontic work such as braces or Invisalign. Q: Can I eat right after I finish brushing? Yes, you can eat right after brushing. To get rid of daily build-up, make sure that the last thing you do before going to bed is to brush your teeth. Q: Why does the Whitening Toothpaste have to go on a dry toothbrush? Our Whitening Toothpaste is best used on a dry toothbrush as our Calprox formula reacts with water, and ideally, that reaction begins with the saliva in your mouth and not water on the toothbrush. Q: What is the recommended time used for brushing? We recommend that you brush your teeth for at least 2 minutes in the morning and 2 minutes at night right before going to bed. It is extremely important to brush at night, because, during the day, we swallow 20,000 times (as we drink and talk, we contribute to the quantity of saliva our mouths produce). At night, however, we only swallow about 20 times, allowing plaque and bacteria to form uninterrupted. If plaque remains on your teeth for a few hours, it turns bacterial thus contributing to plaque buildup and morning breath. Q: What is the advantage of using Supersmile products as opposed to other whitening products? Supersmiles Professional Whitening Toothpaste is recommended by cosmetic dentists worldwide. Clinically proven to whiten teeth 4 shades, and 6 shades when used with Supersmile's Whitening Accelerator. Supersmile Professional Whitening Toothpaste remineralizes teeth with calcium, magnesium, phosphates, and fluoride to restore enamel and fight cavities. Simply put, it is the most convenient and healthy way to powerfully whiten teeth without sensitivity  no messy strips, trays or changes to lifestyle and you can continue to enjoy all your favorite food and beverages. It also uniquely works very well to restore all dental restorations to their original shade, including bonded teeth, veneers, caps, and dentures. No harsh sensitivity-causing bleaches that dehydrate enamel. Free of SLS, parabens, known allergens, animal by-products, and BPA.*** Q: How long will it take to see results? Some people may see results after just one brushing, for some it will take a little longer, but most people will see results in a few days of use as directed. This process is a continuous one. Please remember that there are a lot of factors that go into how long the process takes, such as age, medication, eating habits, dental work, etc. In addition, it depends on the stains: how long they have been there and how deeply rooted they are in the enamel. Positive results will vary. However, you do not have to change any of your eating habits, eat\/drink as usual, continuous brushing will continue to remove stains and whiten.

Human hair is comprised mostly of protein so Soy Protein is an excellent source of vitamins and nutrients.

Our mission was simple: To provide easy-to-use treatments that are both gentle and effective. For all skin types. Women and men. And we still live by these words today. Every product we create is formulated with trusted natural ingredients combined with advanced technologies to deliver exceptional results in the most gentle way  for even the most sensitive skin. Our stores, while modern in every way, are inspired by traditional neighborhood apothecaries: brimming with activity, offering wonderful treatments and knowledgeable customer service. In the early years, Matthew and Andrew personally waited on every customer who walked through their door, and they still live around the corner from their first Chelsea shop. And, of course, their bulldogs at the time, Bob and Junior, became neighborhood (and, eventually, international) superstars thanks to both the customers and passers-by who stopped to photograph the &#034;dogs in the window.&#034;","keywords":"gently foaming cleansing gel synthesizes natural bergamot amino acidbased cleansing agents effectively purifies balances skin types especially sensitive eczema prone unlike traditionally harsh detergents blended hydrate rinsing free residue irritation drying stripping helping reduce epidermal stress natural fragrance color cleansers blended create personalized bathing experiences aromatic foaming bath pour capfuls running water malingoetz simple skincare solutions march matthew malin andrew goetz opened doors new yorks chelsea neighborhood modern apothecary approach luxury skincare mission simple provide easytouse treatments gentle effective skin types women men live words today product create formulated trusted natural ingredients combined advanced technologies deliver exceptional results gentle way sensitive skin stores modern way inspired traditional neighborhood apothecaries brimming activity offering wonderful treatments knowledgeable customer service early years matthew andrew personally waited customer walked door live corner chelsea shop course bulldogs time bob junior neighborhood eventually international superstars thanks customers passersby stopped photograph dogs window","brand":"Malin","price":"44.00","itemModelNumber":"B00FA3QMBI","imageURLHighRes":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/313QfvF4LxL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/31KVeE7ykFL.jpg"],"ranking":"91,957","productDimensions":"7.5 x 2.7 x 2.7 inches ; 13 ounces","shippingWeight":"1.2 pounds","domesticShipping":"Item can be shipped within U.S.","internationalShipping":"This item is not eligible for international shipping.","discontinuedByManufacturer":null,"batteries":null},{"index":1247,"asin":"B002CS4YL4","productTitle":"gloBlush - Spice Berry, 3.4g\/0.12oz","primaryCategory":"Beauty & Personal Care","secondaryCategory":"Luxury Beauty","description":"High-pigment mineral makeup blush for expert color, shading and highlighting.

Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special \"hot soap\" process, it's left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men's shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.  You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades). <img alt=\"\"

This luxurious body scrub is your first step to visibly smoother, firmer, more radiant skin. It&rsquo;s specifically designed to target dull, saggy, crepey skin on your neck, chest, arms, and legs. It contains no plastic microbeads, instead using <strong>exfoliators<\/strong> like rice bran wax and lactic acid to gently buff away dead skin cells and other impurities for smoother, younger-looking skin.

With its fresh, clean fragrance, it invigorates the senses while leaving your skin lightly scented.

The Exfoliating Body Polish's <strong>concentrated moisturizers<\/strong> are the perfect way to combat dry seasonal skin.

Hyaluronic Acid is a carbohydrate molecule that is naturally occurring in our bodies and provides lubrication to the connective tissues of our joints and skin. This is an important part of skin&#039;s overall health. Exo-Polysaccharides, derived from Kopara Polynesian lagoons, stimulate endogenous synthesis of hyaluronic acid, so that the skin creates its own youth molecules and lastingly helps correct pronounced wrinkles. Matrixyl 6 are peptide produced from derivatives of the amino acids lysine and methione sulfone (the latter is synthetic). Palmitoyl tripeptide-38 is a matrikine-mimetic compound that regulates cell activity, wound repair and collagen tissue remodeling. THALGO has been committed to caring for the Oceans seabed.

Our mission was simple: To provide easy-to-use treatments that are both gentle and effective. For all skin types. Women and men. And we still live by these words today. Every product we create is formulated with trusted natural ingredients combined with advanced technologies to deliver exceptional results in the most gentle way  for even the most sensitive skin. Our stores, while modern in every way, are inspired by traditional neighborhood apothecaries: brimming with activity, offering wonderful treatments and knowledgeable customer service. In the early years, Matthew and Andrew personally waited on every customer who walked through their door, and they still live around the corner from their first Chelsea shop. And, of course, their bulldogs at the time, Bob and Junior, became neighborhood (and, eventually, international) superstars thanks to both the customers and passers-by who stopped to photograph the &#034;dogs in the window.&#034;","keywords":"brightening physician grade glycolic acid thoroughly removes dead skin soften smooth healthy radiant glow highly effective glycolic acid clears pores improves clarity texture achieving maximum absorption irritation aggressive chemical peel use antiaging acne treatment regimens natural fragrance color skin types directions night smooth pad clean dry skin avoid eye lip area leave minutes rinse water left overnight pending tolerance follow spf use times week recommended dermatologist malingoetz simple skincare solutions march matthew malin andrew goetz opened doors new yorks chelsea neighborhood modern apothecary approach luxury skincare mission simple provide easytouse treatments gentle effective skin types women men live words today product create formulated trusted natural ingredients combined advanced technologies deliver exceptional results gentle way sensitive skin stores modern way inspired traditional neighborhood apothecaries brimming activity offering wonderful treatments knowledgeable customer service early years matthew andrew personally waited customer walked door live corner chelsea shop course bulldogs time bob junior neighborhood eventually international superstars thanks customers passersby stopped photograph dogs window","brand":"Malin","price":"52.00","itemModelNumber":"B0096A2W92","imageURLHighRes":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51jeM8gvuUL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61A2FcQxrzL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61u%2B1EMh2pL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/31RibwHqsAL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61bCwOTFmpL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51XbHSZ5oTL.jpg"],"ranking":"147,939","productDimensions":"2.9 x 2.9 x 2.9 inches","shippingWeight":"4.8 ounces","domesticShipping":"Item can be shipped within U.S.","internationalShipping":"This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S.","discontinuedByManufacturer":null,"batteries":null},{"index":1570,"asin":"B015WFNJ32","productTitle":"Hand, 4 Count","primaryCategory":"Beauty & Personal Care","secondaryCategory":"Luxury Beauty","description":"Reduce the signs of aging and restore moisture with Age-Defying+ Hand Mask.

Think of your skin as a brick wall. Surface skin cells are the bricks which are surrounded by a naturally occurring intercellular glue (cement). Glycolic Acid found in Transport travels in between our skin cells and breaks down the intercellular glue to accelerate our skins own shedding process. This sophisticated exfoliation speeds up this process to not only reveal healthier, fresher skin cells, but to assist in removing damaged and darkened ones too. Transport, powered by MDT5 features saturated soft cotton pads designed to help improve skin tone, texture and clarity, and an 8% buffered AHA to gently exfoliate dead cells on the skin's surface. How to Use: AM\/PM* | All skin types\/conditions Smooth pad over clean face, neck and dcollet. For best results, use after Nourishing Cleanser and before Serum and A- Bomb\/Skin Reset. * NOTE: A slight tingling sensation is normal. For sensitive skin, squeeze excess liquid from the pad back into the jar for the first few days and build up to regular daily use.","keywords":"transport pads exfoliating abrasion exfoliates treats skin taking new level somme institute transport pads saturated soft cotton pads molecular dispersion technology mdt patented technology highly engineered vitamins designed help improve skin tone texture clarity aha gently exfoliate dead cells skins surface think skin brick wall surface skin cells bricks surrounded naturally occurring intercellular glue cement glycolic acid found transport travels skin cells breaks intercellular glue accelerate skins shedding process sophisticated exfoliation speeds process reveal healthier fresher skin cells assist removing damaged darkened ones transport powered mdt features saturated soft cotton pads designed help improve skin tone texture clarity buffered aha gently exfoliate dead cells skins surface use ampm skin typesconditions smooth pad clean face neck dcollet best results use nourishing cleanser serum bombskin reset note slight tingling sensation normal sensitive skin squeeze excess liquid pad jar days build regular daily use","brand":"Somme","price":"","itemModelNumber":"8-70","imageURLHighRes":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/414V7DZQ-hL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51lT81oynTL.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51CYyd2oSTL.jpg"],"ranking":"340,853","productDimensions":null,"shippingWeight":"8 ounces","domesticShipping":"Item can be shipped within U.S.","internationalShipping":"This item is not eligible for international shipping.","discontinuedByManufacturer":null,"batteries":null},{"index":1620,"asin":"B00NV5GPUA","productTitle":"Organics by Miranda Kerr Foaming Cleanser, 3.04 fl. oz.","primaryCategory":"Beauty & Personal Care","secondaryCategory":"Luxury Beauty","description":"KORA Organics Foaming Cleanser is a gentle, soap free, foaming cleanser formulated for oily to combination skin.
